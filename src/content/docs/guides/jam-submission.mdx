description: A guide to submitting your game to the VRG Game Jam.
---

This guide shows you how to submit a game to the /vrg/ game jam.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a package containing your game. If your game isn't in a package yet, follow [VRChat's guide on how to migrate Assets to a package](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/guides/convert-unitypackage).

Your package will also need an "entry point" prefab, i.e. the prefab that you expect users to drag into their world to use your prefab.

:::tip
If you don't have a project yet, the [tutorial](/tutorial) will walk you through this with a simple example game (and package). And even if you do have an existing package, the tutorial might be useful to understand the flow with a safe throwaway project.

## Step 1. Add the /vrg/ Jam Submission Helper Package

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>
1. Open your web browser and go to https://hiinaspace.github.io/vrgjam2025-vpm-repo/
3. Click the "Add to VCC" button, which should open VCC (VRChat Creator Companion) or ALCOM if you use that.
5. Click the 'Manage Project' Button on your project.
6. Install the `/vrg/ Game Jam 2025 Submission Helper` from the list.
</Steps>

## Step 2. Modify your package metadata

<Steps>
1. Open your package's `package.json` file in a text editor.
2. Update the package metadata to add an `entryPoint` field which points to your root prefab
    ```json title=package.json ins={9}
    {
        "name": "...",
        "displayName": "...",
        "description": "...",
        "author": {
            "name": "...",
            "email": "..."
        },
        "prefabEntryPoint": "Runtime/YourEntryPoint.prefab"
    }
    ```
</Steps>

:::caution
If you don't add this field, the helper won't be able to find your package.

## Step 3. (Pretend To) Submit Your Game

<Steps>
1. Open the VRG Game Jam Submission Helper: `Menu > vrg Game Jam 2025 > Submission Helper`
2. Your package should appear automatically in the dropdown
3. Click "Refresh Validation" to check for issues. There may be some. You can ignore those for now (WIP).
4. Accept the submission agreement.
5. Click "Export as ZIP" to create your submission file.
</Steps>

You'll notice the "Submit" button is grayed out. We're working on it!

## Step 4. Wait warmly for us to update the helper

Once it's updated, you'll be able to update the helper fairly easily:

<Steps>
1. Click "Manage Project" for your project in VCC / ALCOM.
2. You should see a new version of the /vrg/ Jam Submission Helper available.
3. Click the button to upgrade.
</Steps>

## Submitting updated versions

If you need to update your submission, you can do so by following the same steps as above. We'll use the latest version of your package.
