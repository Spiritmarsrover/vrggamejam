description: Make a prefab game
---

In this tutorial, we'll make a game that can be included as a prefab inside any VRChat world.

TODO: insert demo video

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of VRChat world building, Unity, and UdonSharp.

TODO link to tutorials for these things.

## Setting up the Template

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. Download [this zip file](TODO).

2. Extract the contents to a folder on your computer.

3. Open the Vrchat Creator Companion and import the extracted folder as an existing project.

4. Open the project in Unity. A bunch of stuff will download, and the Domain will be Reloaded(tm).

5. While you're waiting for the Domain to reload, move on to the next section.

</Steps>

## Inspect the Project Structure

Check out the project structure in your file browser. It looks like this:

import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<FileTree>

- Assets
  - nothing it's empty!
- Packages
  - party.vrg.jam.example
    - manifest.json
    - Runtime
      - ExampleGame.prefab
    - SamplClick on the manifest.json file in the Assets/Packages/party.vrg.jam.example folder and look at the inspector:es
      - ExampleScene.unity

</FileTree>

If you've made VRChat worlds before, this will look weird! That's okay, it's supposed to be like that.

Once the domain reloads and unity lets you interact with it again, check out the structure of the project in the editor:

The Packages folder has a "vrg game jam example package" in it, but the `party.vrg.jam.example` is gone. Plus there's
a bunch of other stuff there.

## Customize the Package Metadata

Click on the `manifest.json` file in the `Assets/Packages/party.vrg.jam.example` folder and look at the inspector:

Edit the `name`, `displayName`, and `description` fields to something:

Now rename the `party.vrg.jam.example` folder to something else, like `party.vrg.jam.my-awesome-game`.

Now you have a package of your very own.

## Inspect the Example Scene

In the Samples folder, open the `ExampleScene.unity` file. This is a pretty standard VRChat world scene:

There is a 20x20x20 cube for the limits of the your jam submission.

## Create a new MugiGame

Right click the scene and add GameObject > Space.Hiina.Mugi > MugiGame. You'll see a
