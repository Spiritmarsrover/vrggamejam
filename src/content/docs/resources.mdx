## Beginner Resources

If you're actually new to making stuff for VRChat, or the last time you did it was in 2019, you should check out the official docs to get up to speed:

- [Creating Your First World](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/creating-your-first-world/)

## Useful tools

- [Hai's Let Me See](https://docs.hai-vr.dev/docs/products/let-me-see) gives you VR viewing in Edit mode. Useful for checking out the scale and feel of things while developing without having to do the whole test build rigamorole.
- [ClientSim](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/clientsim/) is included in the VRChat SDK nowadays, but it's useful to read about what it can do for you. Being able to test in Play Mode (even if it's only singleplayer/flat) is valuable.
- [Launching Multiple Clients](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/using-build-test): you can also get VRChat to launch multiple instances to test multiplayer interactions by yourself. it's janky and complicated but better than having to ask a friend every time.

## Reference Pages

- [Unity 2022.3 Scripting Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/index.html): inevitable search results will lead you to a slightly different version of unity, so keep this handy.
- [Udon Reference](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/)
- [Udon Data Containers](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/data-containers/): pretty new feature of udon, finally real lists and dictionaries (still janky but better than nothing).
- [Udon Networking](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/networking/) especially for multiplayer games, you'll need to deeply understand what's going on between clients.
