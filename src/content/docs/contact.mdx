Questions about some part of the jam setup or rules? Need help with Mugi or Udon or Unity? Post in the thread, we'll see it.

If you need to contact the organizers privately about something, we'll eventually add some contact info here. In the meantime you can get contact info out of the git repositories for the game jam template or Mugi.

## Where's the discord?

There is no discord. We're trying our best not to shit up the internet with yet another ""server"" where information goes to die.
