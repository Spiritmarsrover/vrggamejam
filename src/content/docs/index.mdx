Welcome to the first /vrg/ Game Jam's documentation! Dunno what this is? Check out [Jam Info](/jam-info).

## News

### August 25th

Added even more docs. Check out [Networking](/guides/networking) and [Optimization](/guides/optimization). [Mugi](/mugi) also has better actual docs, plus some bug fixes now that it actually has users :^).

### August 19th

The submission helper can now actually submit things. The [Submission Guide](/guides/jam-submission) and [Tutorial](/guides/tutorial) will both walk you through it.

### August 15th

Wow, there are actual docs now! Fashionably late, we know.

We reworked the rules to be less weirdly rigid and more like an actual game jam. **Most of the requirements are now just judging criteria**. We still have this certain type of submission in mind that'll score well, but you'll have a lot more flexibility.

If you already started, don't worry, we didn't rugpull you. If you initially got turned off by the rigidity though, give the [Jam Info](/jam-info) another read. Hopefully you'll find some inspiration.

### August 8th

The game jam started! Technically.
