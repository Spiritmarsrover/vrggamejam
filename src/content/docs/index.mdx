Welcome to the first /vrg/ Game Jam's documentation! Dunno what this is? Check out [Jam Info](/jam-info).

## News

### August 15th

Wow, there are actual docs now! Fashionably late, we know.

We reworked the rules to be less weirdly rigid and more like an actual game jam. **Most of the requirements are now just judging criteria**. We still have this certain type of submission in mind that'll score well, but you'll have a lot more flexibility.

If you already started, don't worry, we didn't rugpull you. If you initially got turned off by the rigidity though, give the [Jam Info](/jam-info) another read. Hopefully you'll find some inspiration.

### August 8th

The game jam started! Technically.
