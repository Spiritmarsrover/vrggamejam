import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Choose your path:

## What is all this?

See the [Jam Info](/jam-info) page for what this site is all about.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Jam Info" href="/jam-info" />
</CardGrid>

### Jam sounds great! I already have an idea, but I've never made a prefab.

Check out the [tutorial](/guides/tutorial) first. It'll walk you through the process of making a (simple) game as a prefab and submitting it.
You can then branch out from there.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Tutorial" href="/guides/tutorial" />
</CardGrid>

### Sounds interesting, but I don't have any ideas.

Try out the [tutorial](/guides/tutorial) anyway. It's designed to walk you through making a game without any creativity needed, and you might find some inspiration along the way. Also check out the [Mugi docs](/mugi), which will hopefully make it a lot more feasible to make a game by jam deadline.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Tutorial" href="/guides/tutorial" />
  <LinkCard title="Mini Udon Game Interface (Mugi)" href="/mugi" />
</CardGrid>

### I think I know what I'm doing, but what do I specifically need for the jam?

Check out the jam submission guide and the rules.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Jam Submission" href="/guides/jam-submission" />
  <LinkCard title="Rules" href="/rules" />
</CardGrid>

### I can't make game but I want to try the submissions.

Sure, check out the Jam Info for more details about the Exhibition.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Jam Info" href="/jam-info" />
</CardGrid>

### I don't actually like anything, I just want to shitpost in the thread
