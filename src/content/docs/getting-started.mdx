import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Choose your path:

## The Jam sounds great, I already have an idea!

Try out the tutorial.

<LinkCard title="Tutorial" href="/tutorial" description="tutorial" />

## Sounds interesting, but I'm not convinced yet

Try out the tutorial anyway. It's designed to walk you through making a game
without any creativity needed. You might find it easier than expected.



## I can't make a game but I want to watch

See the rules and exhibition info.
